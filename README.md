# DVD_Store-DB

Project implemented in my Data Base course of my second semester at FMI. Managing a chain of DVD stores named "The Velvet Stage".

You can buy and rent DVDs, which have additional information about them regarding the category they fit into, the director of the film, the actors who acted in it, the languages in which the film was translated.
